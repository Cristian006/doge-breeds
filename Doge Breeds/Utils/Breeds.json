While highly entertaining, the Jack also is difficult to train and is not recommended for first-time dog owners. It is considered an \"escape artist\" that can jump or climb most fences (invisible fence recommended). A combination of intelligence and independence makes this breed strong-willed -- an equally strong-willed owner is necessary. The Jack Russell Terrier is a big dog in a little dog body. It has a killer instinct and had been known to either kill or be killed in dog fights. Its snappish nature requires that it be kept away from most other pets and children (unless raised with them from a young age). As is evidenced by the breeds popularity in the entertainment industry, some Jacks are quite capable of being trained to be obedient and perform all kinds of tricks. However, proper training takes a lot of time, consistency and patience."

However, it does not generally interact well with other dogs and pets. The Yorkie should not be spoiled or over-protected, because it may become neurotic or jealous of others. Demanding of attention, the Yorkie can be perceived as high-maintenance. In particular, \"Teacup\" Yorkies have many behavioral problems. You should only obtain one from a reputable breeder. Be sure to spend time with Yorkie puppies to observe their behavior before choosing one to take home. Select a puppy that is not timid, nor overly aggressive."
