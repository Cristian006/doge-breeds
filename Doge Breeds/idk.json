$t: "Thomas/Tommy was found stray in Palo Alto and we believe this is the second time he has been here, but this time his owners elected not to come get him. He is a shy dog, who will gain confidence as he gets to know you. He is sweet, playful, and would make a great addition to a home with adults only, or older children. If he is barking at you, it only means that he wants to come out and play with you, and doesn't necessarily mean he will bark in your home. Tommy has been neutered, microchipped, and fully vaccinated. If you would like to meet Tommy, please ask a staff member or volunteer!"

He was turned in to the police station and we brought him to the animal shelter. Since there was no sign of an owner, we gave him vaccines, a microchip, and neutered him. He has a mild skin infection for which he is taking a round of antibiotics and he is in need of some dental work. Joe is 75 lbs of jumbo fun and he's strong as an ox. He is an energetic boy and needs a family who can give him lots of exercise and training. If you would like to meet Joe, please ask a staff member or shelter volunteer!"

One of her favorite things is watching children play and once in a while, she will join in. Sometimes even a dog might engage her to play. She is just an easy going gal who would like nothing more than to cuddle up with someone and watch tv together. Even though she is a little bit shy, if she likes you, she might end up giving you a kiss or two. If you would like to meet Miss Nina, please contact her through this site. She is waiting to hear from you! "

Feb. 17th & Sun. Feb. 18th or until adopted. If interested, please fill out an application if you would like the first opportunity to meet prior to the start of the event. (We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) Ollie is a 2 year old Spaniel mix who weighs 14.8lbs. He was a rescue from the shelter. He was listed as a stray. He gets along well with other dogs. He currently lives with big and little dogs. He is not a barker. He needs a home that goes slower with him and gives him a chance to adjust to all new things. He doesn't do well with change. So to be successful, he will need a home that at least initially is quieter, doesn't take him out in public to big crowds or where he has to interact with a lot of people at first. He needs that home that just let's him come in, settle down, get use to everyone and then slowly he can meet others. Ollie will not have a coat that continually grows. What he has now is pretty much all he ever has except in winter it may get a bit thicker. Ollie gets along with cats. He could join a home that has a kid. Ollie is only an option for a home that has had a dog in the last 3 years. If there are kids they need to be teenagers.**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event.

He's still an active dog. No retirement home in his future. He previously lived with a dog his whole life up until a month ago. He's leash reactive and dog choosey. According to his current owner he is best suited as an only dog. He is a great option for someone who loves the velcro nature of an ACD. Gordon's video is from when he was adopted previously.

He has a nonshedding coat that is an option for those who have allergies or simply wants a dog who doesn't shed. He will require regular grooming. He was adopted as a puppy and recently returned to us because they had a baby. Wall-E needs training and he needs a confident and a very experienced home. He shows signs of insecurity and he some basic resource guarding tendencies. An experienced home will be able to address these issues. Wall-E is the best option to be by himself. He does live with dogs in his foster home but he has had issues in other homes with dogs. He seems to pick and choose who he likes unless he is in a very strict, very dog savvy home. He will not be an option for children. We will only consider those homes that are willing to do individual training with him and preference will be given to those who will train with our recommended trainer. Unfortunately he didn't get the boundaries, the training, the confidence that he needed as a puppy and now we have to do it. Wall-E is only an option for those who have had a dog in the last 3 years (owned personally not a parent's or roommates dog and not petsitting a dog).

All dogs live in foster homes. Arrangements to meet dogs occur after an approved application has been accepted. * We do not ship our dogs for any reason. * Our adoption fee is $400 for each dog/puppy. * If it is on a weekend of our adoptions, follow us on @DPSRescue on Twitter to get real time updates on our adoptions.

(We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) Daiquiri is a 2 year old Cairn Terrier who weighs 10.6 lbs. It took about 5 minutes for Daiquiri to become the darling of her foster home. She got attached to her new humans quickly and followed her foster mom around the house while she was busy, and then cuddled up on the couch with her when it was time to take a break. On her second day, she even began to initiate doggy play with her canine foster brother! She currently lives with two dogs. Daiquiri is an amazingly loving little girl who loves to be with her people. She is best suited for someone who has another dog and is not an option for someone who is away 8-5 or long hours by herself. She has done very well in a home with other dogs. However she did not do well being left by herself in a home. Daiquiri is only an option for a home that has had a dog in the last 3 years (owned personally not a parent's or roommates dog and not petsitting a dog). If there are children in the home, they need to be over the age of 8.**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event.

(We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) Love is 1 year old JRT mix who may have a little Beagle in him. He needs that soft, gentle, loving new owner that will just open his/her heart and welcome him in. He was initially shy when meeting folks for the first time but then he began to show a very different side. He settled into his new foster home very easily. He made friends with the 11 year old boy and they are thick as thieves now. Love will be perfect for the right home. He needs a home that is confident and can help him build his confidence. We all thought he might do best with another dog and then in his new foster home he's proven that he doesn't need another dog to blossom. He's doing it all on his own! Here's an update from Love's foster! 'Love is very affectionate and cuddly. He loves to cuddle on my lap. He often follows me around the house everywhere I go. He is also very playful and can play for long periods of time. He likes to play fetch with a small ball or with his plush toys. He sometimes likes to take the toy and just chew on it for a bit. When I am working during the day, Love stays in the x-pen with a fluffly bed, toys, water, and a wee-wee pad. I frequently check on Love using my home's security camera. Love does not bark at all during the day when left home alone. He basically seems to be sleeping and resting all day. Love does not use the wee-wee pad. Love has only gone to the bathroom outside. Love has not had any potty accidents in the house. On the first day I brought Love home I noticed during our walk that he really likes to run. On about day three of having Love I got on my bike to give Love the opportunity to run since I am not a runner. Love loves to run! He ran and ran and ran. He sometimes would run so fast that I could not bike as fast as he could run therefore Love would have to slow down some to wait for me.I have taken Love out for a run on my bike every single day since and I noticed that he barked less in the home when he was taken on runs. As soon as Love sees me put on my bike helmet, he gets very excited. At night I put the fluffly bed in the crate and have Love sleep in the crate. The first few nights he cried for about twenty minutes but now he no longer cries when I crate him at night.' Love was a part of the Seven Virtues who we rescued from a terrible hoarding situation, one of the worst weâve seen in our almost twenty years of rescue. The hoarders reached out to us and begged us to come take their dogs. When we arrived, we realized we didnât have the capacity to take all 30-40 of them into our rescue and we called Animal Control to contact other rescues to come help with the rest. Love will need a home that has had a dog in the last 3 years (owned personally not a parent's or roommates dog and not petsitting a dog). He is an option for a home that is gone during the day- he's cool with staying home alone. If there are children they will need to be 10 years old and be very dog savvy. They will need to be the kind of kids who have grown up with dogs their whole life.**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event.

(We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) Kiki is a 4 year old JRT/Border terrier mix who we rescued from the shelter. They posted a picture of her online with her great smile and we were smitten! Kiki is a lovable gal who simply adores people. Her foster mom says she literally could not be any sweeter. Here's a short description from her: 'There is never a moment that she doesn't have a stuffed toy in her mouth...no seriously, at one point she had 10 toys with her!!! She provided some great entertainment for my sister and I over the past week. She was a delight... although as I'm typing this she is upset at me because I'm ignoring her, lol.' Kiki isn't a big fan of other dogs. She's much more of a people's dog- she's tried and true loyal to her humans and wants to be with them at all times. She'd be ideal for a home that's looking for a one and only dog to love, spoil, and play with. Kiki is an option for a home that has some dog experience, even if it's not recently. She is an option for a home with kids over the age of 6.**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event.

$t: "We will be doing adoptions on Saturday, April 21st from 12-4pm and Sunday, April 22nd from 12-3pm at Palo Alto Pet Food Express. All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, shots current (DHPP, Bordetella and Rabies where applicable), dewormed, flea and tick treated and microchipped. * If you are interested in a dog, please first read the biography on the dog (keep scrolling down for the bio!) and then go to our website, www.dpsrescue.com for an application. * We do not have a facility. All dogs live in foster homes. Arrangements to meet dogs occur after an approved application has been accepted. * We do not ship our dogs for any reason. * Our adoption fee is $400 for each dog/puppy. * If it is on a weekend of our adoptions, follow us on @DPSRescue on Twitter to get real time updates on our adoptions. We will also post at the end of the evening the names of those dogs who have been adopted: www.facebook.com/DPSRescueThis dog will be at the Palo Alto Pet Food Express from 12-4pm on Sat. April 21st & 12-3pm on Sun. April 22nd or until adopted. If interested, please fill out an application if you would like the first opportunity to meet prior to the start of the event. (We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) Callie is a 2 year old Rat Terrier mix who we rescued from the shelter. She's a petite little thing who weighs about 7 lbs tops. Callie loves to be carried. When our rescuer went into the shelter and opened Callie's kennel door, Callie jumped right up into her arms! She seems to be most comfortable when she can be right up next to her human. Callie is tiny enough (and light enough) to fit in a little purse/bag and stick right by your side, running errands with you, etc. The world is a pretty big place for a tiny girl like Callie and she tends to be a bit shy. She will need a patient owner who is willing to give her time to blossom. We know that the right owner with a soft touch will teach her that the world is a happy place and she's safe and loved. She has a sweet temperament and just needs to find her furever person! Callie is only an option for a home that has had a dog in the last 3 years (owned personally not a parent's or roommates dog and not petsitting a dog). If there are children in the home, they need to be over the age of 8 and on the mellower side.**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event. We want to make sure if you are interested in a dog that we have the dog at adoptions but that can only happen if you fill out an application ahead of time and are pre-approved. (Generally this must happen prior to the weekend) **If you are wanting to submit an application within 24 hours of an event, please print off the application and bring with you as well as submitting it. You may still submit it and if time and volunteers permit, we will contact you. Most applications submitted the weekend of adoptions are not responded to until after the adoption weekend. 4/22/18 7:02 PM"

(We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) Brainy is a 3 year old CKC-Tibetan Spaniel mix. He's 21.8lbs. He's a total character. He loves his people. He thrives in an environment that establishes boundaries and rules. If he's allowed to just do whatever he wants, then he is like Dennis the Menace. If he's given structure in his home, he is a completely different dog who flourishes. He loves exploring when he first gets to a new home. He sniffed every inch of his foster home and when he was done he went and crashed on the floor. Brainy was adopted and returned to us recently. When he was adopted he was adopted out with the caveat that he needed a home that didn't allow Brainy to run the house and that would offer him a structured environment. He needs boundaries and rules. Unfortunately he didn't receive that. He ultimately was returned because he was reactive to people as they came in the home. In his current foster home, he is crated when people enter. He is not allowed out until he is calm and relaxed. Brainy will require a home that understands leadership based training as opposed to positive reinforcement. He worked with three different positive reinforcement trainers and he was still returned. We had him work with a trainer that teaches boundaries, guidelines and expects the owner to be the leader and Brainy responded perfectly. He needs that kind of home. Brainy gets along with other dogs. He likes other dogs. Brainy lives with a cat. He ignores the cat after thoroughly sniffing the cat. And if the cat disappears for several hours and reappears, he'll sniff again. He has to make sure the cat hasn't been into mischief! Brainy is only an option for those homes who have had a dog in the last 3 years (owned personally not a parent's or roommates dog and not petsitting a dog). If there are kids in the home they need to be over the age of 8.**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event.

(We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) Pot O' Gold (ok so we don't really call him that...but c'mon, go with us. We have a theme happening here folks!) aka Goldie is a 5 year old Bichon-Maltese. He has a nonshedding coat that is an option for those who have allergies or simply want a dog who doesn't shed. We will be looking for a home that has an understanding of the grooming needs of these dogs. We want to make sure for a lifetime this boy will be well cared for... Goldie needs a strong, experienced dog owner. He needs someone who is confident and sets boundaries. He thrive in that environment. But for those folks who are less experienced, less confident, he doesn't do well. He excels in a home that will give him the opportunity to settle in and not have high expectations of him initially. He needs his space to find his place in the new home. Once he is settled (1-2 weeks) he really falls in love with his people. He is a cuddler and a snuggler. He is also housetrained and knows how to use a doggy door. Goldie gets along well with other dogs. He hasn't shown any issues with any dog he has lived with thus far. He also lives with cats. He loves to groom one of the cats. It's kind of funny. He's such a sweet boy with a heart of gold! Goldie is only an option for a home that has had a dog in the last 3 years of their own (not parents/family dog, roommates dog or pet sitting). If there are children they need to be dog savvy individuals who have grown up with dogs in their home and at least 12 years old.**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event.

$t: "We will be doing adoptions on Saturday, April 21st from 12-4pm and Sunday, April 22nd from 12-3pm at Palo Alto Pet Food Express. All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, shots current (DHPP, Bordetella and Rabies where applicable), dewormed, flea and tick treated and microchipped. * If you are interested in a dog, please first read the biography on the dog (keep scrolling down for the bio!) and then go to our website, www.dpsrescue.com for an application. * We do not have a facility. All dogs live in foster homes. Arrangements to meet dogs occur after an approved application has been accepted. * We do not ship our dogs for any reason. * Our adoption fee is $400 for each dog/puppy. * If it is on a weekend of our adoptions, follow us on @DPSRescue on Twitter to get real time updates on our adoptions. We will also post at the end of the evening the names of those dogs who have been adopted: www.facebook.com/DPSRescueThis dog will be at the Palo Alto Pet Food Express from 12-4pm on Sat. April 21st & 12-3pm on Sun. April 22nd or until adopted. If interested, please fill out an application if you would like the first opportunity to meet prior to the start of the event. (We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) Dublin is a 2 year old Malti-Poo who weighs 14.8lbs. He has a nonshedding coat that is an option for those who have allergies. He had to be shaved down because he came in with such a matted coat. We will be looking for a home that has a grooming plan for him because it's so unfair to these dogs not to have them groomed regularly. Nonshedding is awesome but only if you are willing to put the time and money into grooming! Dublin gets along well with other dogs. He currently lives with big and little dogs. He also has lived by himself and is an option to be someone's one and only. He is a shy dog who will take a patient, slowed down approach to win him over. Once he knows you he is very loving. He is a velcro kind of dog. He will follow you from room to room. He is an ideal candidate for a home that is home more than they are away. He wouldn't be the best fit for a home that works a regular schedule outside of the house. He is not a fan of the crate. Some other type of containment would be best for him. Dublin is an option to live with cats. Dublin is only an option for a home that has had a dog in the last 3 years (owned personally not a parent's or roommates dog and not petsitting a dog). If there are children they need to be very dog savvy and over the age of 12. **Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event. We want to make sure if you are interested in a dog that we have the dog at adoptions but that can only happen if you fill out an application ahead of time and are pre-approved. (Generally this must happen prior to the weekend) **If you are wanting to submit an application within 24 hours of an event, please print off the application and bring with you as well as submitting it. You may still submit it and if time and volunteers permit, we will contact you. Most applications submitted the weekend of adoptions are not responded to until after the adoption weekend. 4/22/18 7:02 PM"

(We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) The States litter are 10 week old tiny little munchkins who we rescued from the shelter. Mom is about 45 lbs and we suspect Dad was quite a bit smaller, as the puppies are petite for their age. These little darlings are set up in amazing foster homes that are giving them 24/7 attention. They are having a blast! All 8 of the puppies are good-natured little ones whose individual personalities are slowly emerging as they grow and explore the big wide world. Adoptive families will need to be prepared to raise a puppy with all that entails, including housebreaking, good puppy manners, and socialization. We will only consider homes that have owned a dog of their own in the last 3 years (not parents/roommate/pet sitting) . If there are children in the home, they need to be over the age of 8.**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event.

(We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) Princess Leia is a 4 year old Maltese-Yorkie (Morkie) Terrier mix who weighs about 8 lbs. She's a petite and adorable little gal who's super friendly once she's established that you're good people. She'll play coy and be a bit shy at first but then she's all love! She's a total cuddle bug. Leia has a non-shedding coat that makes her an option for those with allergies. She will require regular grooming and we will be looking for families with a groomer lined up. Here are notes from Leia's foster mom: 'Leia is such a loving dog. She loves snuggles and pets and will give so much love for a place in your heart. She will kiss you as long as possible if you let her... She loves to play short games of tug o' war and likes to catch and shake her soft rag toy. She is working so hard on potty training and on a schedule does beautifully. She is so smart and eager to please. She loves to be with people but is fine on her own while you are away at work - but if her Mom or Dad worked from home or could take her to work, that would work, too. She loves snuggling on chairs and sofas and is responding so well to positive reinforcement. She has easily learned to sit for rewards and is food and positive word motivated. She is easy to train and eager to please and be a loving and devoted member of the family. She is GREAT with kids. She's such a sweet, sweet little dog...' Leia gets along well with other dogs and is also an option for a home with cats. She is a dog that may be an option for those who have experience but maybe not recent. If there are children in the home, they need to be over the age of 8.**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event.

(We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) Gizmo is a 4 year old Pom-Schipperke mix. He was a rescue from the shelter. He had an owner who left him at the shelter. We took him in. He is an absolute lover boy who by no fault of his own had a family that in the 8+ days he was at the shelter never came to claim him. We are blown away because this boy is so sweet and loving. From his foster home: 'We had a wonderful time fostering Gizmo in our home. He really loves the morning walks with my husband and our dog, Nayeli. He is such a breeze to care for and it is a plus that he is completely house trained. He's very cuddly and loves to be around people and meet new people. Plays well with other dogs including the dogs at the dog park. He enjoyed bath time and loved the blow dryer and being brushed. He does have a little mischievous side which is very endearing and adds to his personality. He really loves the attention that we give him and he's always the first one to get the morning cuddle and late night 'goodnights'. He also dances in circles when he gets really excited.' Gizmo gets along well with other dogs. He lives with big and little dogs. He isn't bothered by anyone he's met so far. He could easily be a dog who goes to the dog park or doggy day camp but in reality he's the type of dog who would most like to go to work with Mom or Dad and hang out in their office. He likes being a part of his human's world without being over the top needy. Gizmo is a dog who would love to visit Starbucks on Saturday morning while his Mom sips her coffee and reads the NYT's. Gizmo has proven to not be a nuisance barker. Gizmo could be an option for a home that has less experience but is prepared for inviting a dog into their home. If there are children they need to be over the age of 8.**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event.

$t: "We will be doing adoptions on Saturday, April 21st from 12-4pm and Sunday, April 22nd from 12-3pm at Palo Alto Pet Food Express. All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, shots current (DHPP, Bordetella and Rabies where applicable), dewormed, flea and tick treated and microchipped. * If you are interested in a dog, please first read the biography on the dog (keep scrolling down for the bio!) and then go to our website, www.dpsrescue.com for an application. * We do not have a facility. All dogs live in foster homes. Arrangements to meet dogs occur after an approved application has been accepted. * We do not ship our dogs for any reason. * Our adoption fee is $400 for each dog/puppy. * If it is on a weekend of our adoptions, follow us on @DPSRescue on Twitter to get real time updates on our adoptions. We will also post at the end of the evening the names of those dogs who have been adopted: www.facebook.com/DPSRescueThis dog will be at the Palo Alto Pet Food Express from 12-4pm on Sat. April 21st & 12-3pm on Sun. April 22nd or until adopted. If interested, please fill out an application if you would like the first opportunity to meet prior to the start of the event. (We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) Chief is a 5 year old Chi who we rescued from the shelter. At 4.10 lbs, he's a tiny guy and could go everywhere and do anything with future family. If you want a dog who can hide in your purse as you walk around your favorite stores, then he's an option. If you want a dog who fits under the seat of an airplane, then he's there to join you on your travels. Chief's foster mom describes him as 'a little star!' He's a very sweet little guy who just loves to be carried around in his foster mom's arms like a little prince. He's also got some energy and will make a great walking buddy for his future adopter. Chief gets along well with other dogs, but his humans are of course the number one priority for him. Unlike some of his breed, Chief is not a nuisance barker. He's a relatively chill kind of guy. Chief is an option to live with cats. Of course the cat in his foster home is bigger than him. Chief is crate trained and sleeps in his crate at night. Chief is only an option for a home that has had a dog in the last 3 years. If there are children in the home, they need to be over the age of 8 and on the gentle side so they don't end up hurting this petite little fella!**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event. We want to make sure if you are interested in a dog that we have the dog at adoptions but that can only happen if you fill out an application ahead of time and are pre-approved. (Generally this must happen prior to the weekend) **If you are wanting to submit an application within 24 hours of an event, please print off the application and bring with you as well as submitting it. You may still submit it and if time and volunteers permit, we will contact you. Most applications submitted the weekend of adoptions are not responded to until after the adoption weekend. 4/22/18 7:02 PM"

(We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) Bentley is a 4 year old Fox Terrier mix who we rescued from the shelter. He was clearly someone's pet at some point because he knows how to walk well on-leash and jumped right up into his foster's car, ready to go. Here is a report from Bentley's foster mom: Bentley is doing great. He is very lovely and spunky! He is confident, jumped right into the car when I picked him up. The first day he even rolled over for belly rubs. He is very playful, and is lightning fast. He also loves to leap over you and onto his cozy blanket on the couch. It's great fun (although he did surprise foster mommy the first time...). Then he cuddles and falls asleep as you rub his belly. He is quiet at night. We confine him to the kitchen with a doggy bed and he doesn't make a sound all night. No accidents in the house so far but we do take him out often. He is a little sensitive about his back legs, but he loves to run and is very agile (might be great at agility). He does need some work on good doggy manners, he will jump up on you often, he is very enthusiastic. But he is very sweet, alert and food motivated so he will do well with training. Bentley is only an option for a home with dog experience. He is an option for kids over the age of 8 who are knock-over-proof and don't mind his enthusiasm.**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event.

(We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) Swiss is a 1 year old Chug (Chihuahua-Pug mix) who weighs 9lbs. He was rescued in Korea from the meat market fate. He traveled to the US to find a new home. He is a quiet, mellow, get along with everyone kind of guy. He is a cuddler and a snuggler. He's definitely a lap dog. He will initially be shy with strangers. He won't run up and declare his love upon meeting. But once he knows you, he'll smother with love. Swiss gets along well with other dogs. He currently lives with big and little dogs and gets along with everyone he has met thus far. He's not necessarily a dog who wants to play or at least it's not something we have seen. Rather he seems to co-exist peacefully with other dogs. Swiss has not proven to be a dog who is a nuisance barker in his foster home. He may be an option for living in an apartment or condo setting. He could be an option for going to work with Mom or Dad if they have a dog friendly office. He is the type that will hang out under the desk or in the corner of the office. He's not necessarily going to be one who runs up and meets and greets strangers initially. Swiss is a dog who could go to a home that has had some experience but not necessarily recent experience. If there are children they need to be over the age of 10. **All Korean dogs have had 2 series of Canine Influenza shots prior to coming to the US.**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event.

$t: "We will be doing adoptions on Saturday, April 21st from 12-4pm and Sunday, April 22nd from 12-3pm at Palo Alto Pet Food Express. All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, shots current (DHPP, Bordetella and Rabies where applicable), dewormed, flea and tick treated and microchipped. * If you are interested in a dog, please first read the biography on the dog (keep scrolling down for the bio!) and then go to our website, www.dpsrescue.com for an application. * We do not have a facility. All dogs live in foster homes. Arrangements to meet dogs occur after an approved application has been accepted. * We do not ship our dogs for any reason. * Our adoption fee is $400 for each dog/puppy. * If it is on a weekend of our adoptions, follow us on @DPSRescue on Twitter to get real time updates on our adoptions. We will also post at the end of the evening the names of those dogs who have been adopted: www.facebook.com/DPSRescueThis dog will be at the Palo Alto Pet Food Express from 12-4pm on Sat. April 21st & 12-3pm on Sun. April 22nd or until adopted. If interested, please fill out an application if you would like the first opportunity to meet prior to the start of the event. (We will pre-approve one home to meet per dog.) The Sushi litter is 3 1/2 months old. They have short little legs and long body like a Corgi and Mom looked like Flat Coated Retriever without legs. We met Mom and she was cute and friendly. It was clear she had a whole lot of different dogs within her. She probably weighed 35-40lbs but she looked like a Retriever on a Corgi body. We expect the puppies will be in the 30-40lbs range. They won't be the size of a Flat Coated Retriever. The Sushi litter previously lived with other dogs big and small. They had a blast playing with dogs. They currently live in a foster with a Chow and two small dogs. They also live with a cat who they routinely remind why he hates puppies. He finds a place high enough to get away from them but when he comes back, they're there to play! They also love to play with toys. They raided the toy box and scattered the toys all over the house. They had an absolute blast. The foster mom? Not so happy. Welcome to puppies! The Sushi pups love to snuggle and cuddle. They spent the weekend watching Netflix with the teens in the house and hanging out with the family. They entertained themselves and the family. They had some good time playing in the yard and then came in to cuddle up on the couch. They are not big barkers. Initially coming into their foster home they were on the quieter side. It took about 24 hours before they blossomed and became full on puppies. It took some time for their personalities to develop. The Sushi pups are only an option for those who have had a dog in the last 3 years (does not include family dogs/roommates dogs/petsitting dogs). If there are children they need to be over the age of 8.**Not all of our dogs go to each adoption event. We want to make sure if you are interested in a dog that we have the dog at adoptions but that can only happen if you fill out an application ahead of time and are pre-approved. (Generally this must happen prior to the weekend) **If you are wanting to submit an application within 24 hours of an event, please print off the application and bring with you as well as submitting it. You may still submit it and if time and volunteers permit, we will contact you. Most applications submitted the weekend of adoptions are not responded to until after the adoption weekend. 4/22/18 7:02 PM"
